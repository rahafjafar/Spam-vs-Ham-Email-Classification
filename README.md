# 📧 Spam Email Classification Project

## Overview
The Spam Email Classification Project aims to develop a precise and efficient machine learning model to automatically classify emails as **spam** or **non-spam (ham)**. Spam emails are a persistent nuisance in digital communication, often containing advertisements, phishing links, or malicious content. Efficient filtering is essential to reduce their impact on users and improve overall email security.

## Introduction
Spam emails are unsolicited messages sent in bulk, typically for advertising, scamming, or spreading malware. They clutter inboxes, waste time, and pose serious security risks. The growing prevalence of spam necessitates advanced detection techniques.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and features in emails, enabling the system to distinguish between legitimate emails and spam. By automating the classification process, the model provides a faster and more reliable mechanism for spam detection, enhancing user experience and protecting against potential threats.
